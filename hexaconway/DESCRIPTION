Description: HexaNetworkConway initiates a network object to represent Conway's hexagonal Universe. The starting pattern can either be randomly generated or choosen by yourself. Currently 7 different rulesets are implemented to compute the state of the next generation from a Newman's Neighbourhood. (Rulesets computing the next generation's state from a Moore-Neighbourhood are planned.) Finally, the graphics are displayed on a hexagonal grid.
